# IODS-project

This is a temporary project that exists only to complete mandatory
classwork for the Open Data Science class at Helsinki University.  I
expect to hide or remove this repository after December 2020.

## Course diary

### Week 1

Thoughts after the first week:

* Created IODS-project repository
* Installed R and Rstudio on Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux).  Rstudio (latest
  1.3.1093) keeps crashing very frequenty.  R seems to work.  For now
  I'm using Rscript to generate HTML from the .Rmd files.
* I've used github for years so that part was easy.
* Rstudio did not clone the github repository as I would like.  It did not
  store the username in the cloned repository correctly. Thus manual
  ``git pull`` or ``git push`` did not work properly with SSH keys (it asked
  for git username and password).  I had to tweak it manually to make
  SSH keys work correctly.
* The actual information on the lecture could have been presented much
  faster. I will probably read the information from the book/web
  pages/transcripts in the coming weeks rather than listening to
  lectures.

### Week 2

Thoughts for the second week:

* It took some time to find out how to use R.  I'm not a fan of its
  programming language syntax, but it certainly seems useful for various
  statistical and plotting tasks once you learn the different libraries.
  The challenge is that you need to become familiar with a number of
  libraries.  In some sense python, pandas, scikit, and matplotlib still
  feels easier for me.
* I've used various types of linear regression many times in the past
  (least squares, Lasso, Ridge), but haven't really looked at
  significance analysis and the distribution of residual errors in the
  past.  I think that analysis may turn out to be a useful tool for me
  in the future.  I would probably implement in Python for my machine
  learning applications rather than use R though.
* Rmarkdown is kind of a cool idea and nice for prototyping or coursework,
  but I still fail to see how to utilize it for an academic paper.  The nice
  thing is that it leaves a trail that makes repeating the procedure easy.

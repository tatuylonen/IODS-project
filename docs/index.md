# IODS-project

This is a temporary project that exists only to complete mandatory
classwork for the Open Data Science class at Helsinki University.  I
expect to hide or remove this repository after December 2020.

## Course diary

### Week 1

* Created IODS-project repository
* Installed r and Rstudio on Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux).  Initially Rstudio
  crashed when started, but installing latest updates and rebooting
  fixed the problem.
* This week's assignments were stuff I am very familiar with.
* The actual information on the lecture could have been presented much
  faster. I will probably read the information from the book/web
  pages/transcripts in the coming weeks rather than listening to
  lectures.

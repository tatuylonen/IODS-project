# IODS-project

This is a temporary project that exists only to complete mandatory
classwork for the Open Data Science class at Helsinki University.  I
expect to hide or remove this repository after December 2020.

## Course diary

### Week 1

Thoughts after the first week:
* Created IODS-project repository
* Installed R and Rstudio on Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux).  Rstudio (latest
  1.3.1093) keeps crashing very frequenty.  R seems to work.  For now
  I'm using Rscript to generate HTML from the .Rmd files.
* I've used github for years so that part was easy.
* Rstudio did not clone the github repository as I would like.  It did not
  store the username in the cloned repository correctly. Thus manual
  ``git pull`` or ``git push`` did not work properly with SSH keys (it asked
  for git username and password).  I had to tweak it manually to make
  keys work correctly.
* The actual information on the lecture could have been presented much
  faster. I will probably read the information from the book/web
  pages/transcripts in the coming weeks rather than listening to
  lectures.

## About the project

This is an introductory open data science course for PhD students at
University of Helsinki (with some students from other universities).
The course is open to everyone, uses open source tools, and emphasizes
open science.  The statistics part seems fairly elementary, but I
could use a brush-up and that is why I signed up for the course.

The course seems to cover github, R, Rstudio, linear and logistic
regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, hypothesis testing
and some other basic multivariate statistical analysis tools.

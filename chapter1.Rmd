## Chapter 1: About the project

This repository is for an introductory open data science class for PhD
students at University of Helsinki (with some students from other
universities).  The course is open to everyone, uses open source
tools, and emphasizes open science.  The statistics part seems fairly
elementary, but I could use a brush-up and that is why I signed up for
the course.

The course seems to cover github, R, Rstudio, linear and logistic
regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, hypothesis testing
and some other basic multivariate statistical analysis tools.

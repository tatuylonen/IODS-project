## Course diary

### Week 1

Thoughts after the first week:

* Created IODS-project repository
* Installed R and Rstudio on Ubuntu 20.04 (Linux).  Rstudio (latest
  1.3.1093) keeps crashing very frequenty.  R seems to work.  For now
  I'm using Rscript to generate HTML from the .Rmd files.
* I've used github for years so that part was easy.
* Rstudio did not clone the github repository as I would like.  It did not
  store the username in the cloned repository correctly. Thus manual
  ``git pull`` or ``git push`` did not work properly with SSH keys (it asked
  for git username and password).  I had to tweak it manually to make
  SSH keys work correctly.
* The actual information on the lecture could have been presented much
  faster. I will probably read the information from the book/web
  pages/transcripts in the coming weeks rather than listening to
  lectures.

### Week 2

Thoughts for the second week:

* I went through the DataCamp exercises.  The platform was simple and
  easy to use, even though this would not have been my preferred mode
  of learning.  I would rather have read a description of the R
  philosophy and how main commands work and then approached it as a
  programming language.  Now rather than learning the basics we are
  forced to learn snippets that may be useful in themselves, but we
  don't learn to understand what options and commands really mean or
  what the philosophy and basic concepts are.
* It took some time to find out how to use R.  I'm not a fan of its
  programming language syntax, but it certainly seems useful for various
  statistical and plotting tasks once you learn the different libraries.
  The challenge is that you need to become familiar with a number of
  libraries.  In some sense python, pandas, scikit, and matplotlib still
  feels easier for me.
* I've used various types of linear regression many times in the past
  (least squares, Lasso, Ridge), but haven't really looked at
  significance analysis and the distribution of residual errors in the
  past.  I think that analysis may turn out to be a useful tool for me
  in the future.  I would probably implement in Python for my machine
  learning applications rather than use R though.
* Rmarkdown is kind of a cool idea and nice for prototyping or coursework,
  but I still fail to see how to utilize it for an academic paper.  The nice
  thing is that it leaves a trail that makes repeating the procedure easy.

### Week 3

Thoughts after the third week

* I'm becoming frustrated.  I read throught the chapters of the book,
  but found them too general and vague, lacking precise analysis and
  description of the topics.  Perhaps I'd prefer a more mathematical
  approach to the topics.
* I'm finding I really dislike R syntax and the study approach taken
  in the data camp exercises.  They are not hard, but they are
  performing tasks without first gaining an understanding of the
  available commands and operations.  We haven't look at even the
  basic concepts of the *programming language* that R is, yet we are
  learning and memorizing snippets in the hope that they might be used
  for something useful.  As someone with a long programming
  background, I'm finding this approach very frustrating, inefficient,
  and annoying.  I'm waiting for a book on R programming to arrive.
* I do appreciate the graphics and significant testing that is easily
  available with R packages.
* The Super-Bonus exercise was fun.

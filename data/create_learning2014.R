# RStudio Exercise 2 - data wrangling

# This uses the data set described in:
# Kimmo Vehkalahti: ASSIST 2014 - Phase 3 (end of Part 2), N=183
# Course: Johdatus yhteiskuntatilastotieteeseen, syksy 2014
# (Introduction to Social Statistics, fall 2014 - in Finnish),
# international survey of Approaches to Learning, made possible
# by Teachers' Academy funding for KV in 2013-2015.
